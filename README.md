# Library Management System Application

This application allows user to manage a library system via command line inputs. There are 4 core components to this library management system.
Users are able to store information about books, users, authors, and genres. Users can add new books, users, authors, or genres to the system, and search for
them each of these at a later time. There is also functionality to check out a book, and return it at a later date. When a book is checked out, no
other users can checkout the same book, until it is returned. There is also functionality to see all stored books, users, authors, or genres in order
to see what is stored in the system. This allows users to easily see which books are available and which arent'.
